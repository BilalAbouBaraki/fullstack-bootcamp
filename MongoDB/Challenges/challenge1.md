# Node.js and MongoDB Challenges

## Challenge 1: Create a Basic Node.js Application

**Objective:** Understand the foundational principles of a Node.js application.

### Setup:

- Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are correctly installed on your system.

### Tasks:

1. **Project Initialization:** Begin by initializing a new node project from the terminal. This action will generate a package.json file, which describes your app and its dependencies.
2. **Simple Program Creation:** Write a program in the app.js file to create a node server on port 5000 and console log that the server is running on port.
3. **Program Execution:** run the Node.js program using the command line.
